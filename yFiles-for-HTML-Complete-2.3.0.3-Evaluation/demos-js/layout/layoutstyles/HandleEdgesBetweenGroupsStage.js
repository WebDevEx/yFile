 * This stage temporarily removes edges that are incident to group nodes.
 *
 * The stage must be prepended to the layout algorithm and applies the following three steps:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Removes edges from the graph that are incident to group nodes.</li>
 *   <li>Invokes the core layout algorithm on the reduced graph.</li>
 *   <li>Re-inserts all previously removed edges and optionally places their labels.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This stage can be useful for layout algorithms or stages that cannot handle edges between group nodes, e.g.,
 * {@link TreeReductionStage}. Optionally, {@link HandleEdgesBetweenGroupsStage} can also place the labels of
 * the edges that were temporarily removed right after they are restored back to the graph.
 *
 * The routing of the temporarily hidden edges can be customized by specifying an
 * {@link #getMarkedEdgeRouter() edge routing algorithm} for those edges.
