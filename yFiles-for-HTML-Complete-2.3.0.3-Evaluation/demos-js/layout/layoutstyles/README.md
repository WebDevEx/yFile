# Layout Styles Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/layout/layoutstyles/index.html).

This demo showcases the most used layout algorithms of yFiles, including hierarchic, organic, orthogonal, tree, circular, balloon, and several edge routing styles.

The configuration panel provides access to the most important settings of each algorithm. Typically, an algorithm allows even more options in code.

Since not every layout style works well for every type of graph, we provide several suitable sample graphs.

The interactive editing capabilities of the graph component of this demo are explained in the [Graph Editor Demo](../../view/grapheditor/index.html).

## Things to Try

- Browse the _Sample Graphs_ and _Layout Styles_.
- Explore the various _configuration options_ of the layout algorithms.
- Run a layout algorithm with the selected settings by pressing the _Apply_ button.
- Restore the default settings of an algorithm with the _Reset_ button.
