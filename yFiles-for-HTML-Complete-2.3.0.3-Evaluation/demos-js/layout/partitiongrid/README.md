# Partition Grid Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/layout/partitiongrid/index.html).

This demo application lets you experience the usage of a [PartitionGrid](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/PartitionGrid) for hierarchic and organic layout calculations.

Nodes are assigned to columns/rows by their fill color (gray nodes are unassigned) and the calculated partition grid is visualized after a layout run to show the effect of the node assignment to the layout.

## Things to try

- Click the Hierarchic or Organic button of the toolbar to trigger the corresponding layout algorithm based on the current node assignment. Note that, the Organic layout doesn't support stretching of a group node if it contains child nodes assigned to different rows or columns. In this case, the Organic layout button will be disabled.
- Change the partition cell of a (non-gray) node by moving it to a different partition cell. For the gray nodes that do not have currently active restrictions, select the desired ones and press the ![](resources/grid-16.svg)\-button from the toolbar to add restrictions based on their current location. Then, move them to other partition cells, if desired. Nodes that are positioned outside the partition grid do not receive a restriction.
- Add/remove active restrictions to/from the selected nodes, using buttons ![](resources/grid-16.svg) or ![](../../resources/icons/delete2-16.svg) of the toolbar.
- Configure the partition grid using the settings panel on the right.
- Remove a row/column from the partition grid, by right-clicking on a cell that belongs to the desired row/column and use the "Delete Row" or "Delete Column" of the settings panel on the right.
