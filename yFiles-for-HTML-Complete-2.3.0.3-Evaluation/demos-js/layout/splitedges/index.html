    <p>
      This demo shows how to use split ids to align edges outside with edges inside a group nodes in <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RecursiveGroupLayout" target="_blank">RecursiveGroupLayout</a>.
      In <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RecursiveGroupLayout" target="_blank">RecursiveGroupLayout</a> the routing for inter-edges is sometimes not satisfactory.
      Inter-edges are edges that connect nodes outside of a group with nodes inside of this group. Since
      RecursiveGroupLayout routes these edges after the rest of the graph is arranged, they sometimes don't fit into the
      overall layout style.
    </p>
    <p>
      In combination with <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/HierarchicLayout" target="_blank">HierarchicLayout</a>, inter-edges can be replaced with two edges that
      are aligned at the group node. <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/HierarchicLayout" target="_blank">HierarchicLayout</a> provides the option that an edge is
      routed directly from the border of a group nodes to a node inside of this group node instead of leaving the group node first.
    </p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>
    Change the graph and the split ids of the edges and see how the layout changes, too. Edges with split ids are
    colored different than grey.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Align edges that connect to the same group nodes from the outside and the inside. Select two or more edges that
        are connected a group and choose 'Align Selected Edges' from the context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unalign edges to delete the split ids. Select at least one edge with a split id and choose 'Unalign Selected
        Edges' from the context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select an inter-edge and split it into several edges that connect to the formerly crossed group using the
        context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select an aligned edge and join it with all edges that have the same split id using the context menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split all inter-edges of a group node with the context menu of the group node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Join edges at a group node that share a split id with the context menu of a group node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Normal nodes and edges do not provide a context menu.
      </li>
    </ul>
