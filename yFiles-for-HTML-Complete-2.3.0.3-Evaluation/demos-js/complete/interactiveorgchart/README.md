# Interactive Organization Chart Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/complete/interactiveorgchart/index.html).

This demo shows how to create an interactive organization chart from JSON data.

The source data is easily converted to a yFiles graph using class [TreeBuilder](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/TreeBuilder).

The visualization of the employee is defined by an svg-template which is interpreted by the node style using the [Vue.js-framework](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html).

The demo also shows how a [FilteredGraphWrapper](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/FilteredGraphWrapper) can be used to display a subgraph of the model graph.

## Automatic Layout

The organization chart is layouted automatically with the [TreeLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/TreeLayout) and the [CompactNodePlacer](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/CompactNodePlacer) which determines the best arrangement strategy for each node in order to achieve a compact and clear layout.
