  <h3>How to create a basic view.</h3>

  <p>This step introduces class <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphComponent" target="_blank">GraphComponent</a>, which is the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/getting_started-application" target="_blank"> central UI element for working with graphs</a>. The application does not
    provide any interactive features except mouse wheel zooming, which is enabled by default. It is merely meant as a
    very basic example of how to display a GraphComponent within a web page.</p>

  <p>See the sources for details.</p>

  <p>Please note that the subsequent tutorial steps use a web component framework (demo-utils) to reduce the amount of
    code that is needed to demonstrate the relevant features. All of the code samples included in this distribution are
    also feasible using plain HTML and JavaScript together with yFiles HTML. </p>

  <h4>Important Note</h4>
  <p>
    yFiles provides <a
    href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/index.html#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds"
    target="_blank">workarounds</a> which address several bugs in current browsers. Find <code>demos-js/resources/demo-util.js</code>
    as a reference on how several of them are enabled for most of the demos and how to enable them for this demo, too.
