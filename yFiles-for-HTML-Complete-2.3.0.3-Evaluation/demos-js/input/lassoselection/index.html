  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">
    <p>This demo shows how to configure <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/LassoSelectionInputMode" target="_blank">LassoSelectionInputMode</a> for lasso selection mode.
      In this mode, graph items can be selected very flexible by dragging a lasso line around them.</p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Switch between the selection styles:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Free-hand lasso selection will create a curved line while dragging and
            select the items when releasing the mouse button
          </li>
          <li>
            Polyline lasso selection will start a segment while dragging and create a bend when releasing the mouse
            button. The selection is finished when the mouse button is released within the radius around the start point
            or on double-click.
          </li>
          <li>
            Marquee selection is the default selection style in <em>yFiles for HTML</em>. It is used as a reference here.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the finish radius: When the mouse-button is released at the start point, the selection is finished. The
        finish radius determines how close to the start point this must happen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select different conditions to select nodes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select Intersected Nodes: Nodes will end up in the selection if the lasso contains or at least intersects
            with their layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select Complete Nodes: Nodes will only be selected if the lasso completely contains them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select Node's Center: The selection will only contain nodes whose center is inside the lasso line.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Note that on touch devices the selection gestures starts with a long press.
