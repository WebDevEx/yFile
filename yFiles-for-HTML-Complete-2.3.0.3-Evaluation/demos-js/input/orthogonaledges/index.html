  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">

    <p>This demo shows the customization of orthogonal edge editing.</p>

    <p>Using the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphDecorator" target="_blank">GraphDecorator</a>, the edge is decorated with custom implementations of
       the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IOrthogonalEdgeHelper" target="_blank">IOrthogonalEdgeHelper</a> interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>

    <p>Drag segments and bends of the edges and observe the different characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Edge Types</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-red demo-bold">Red edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is disabled. The segments are
        straight lines with arbitrary slope. Dragging an unselected segment creates a new bend.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-green demo-bold">Green edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is enabled. While dragging, all
        segments stay orthogonal and new bends are created as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-purple demo-bold">Purple edge</em>: Same behavior as the green edge. In addition, the
        locations of the source port and target port are constraint to the given port candidates of the nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-orange demo-bold">Orange edge</em>: Same behavior as the green edge. In addition, the
        source port and the target port can be placed at any location inside the node since they use dynamic port
        candidates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em class="demo-blue demo-bold">Blue edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is enabled for the inner segments
        but the first and the last segment can have an arbitrary slope. If a new bend is added to one of these two
        segments, the newly created inner segment becomes orthogonal immediately.
