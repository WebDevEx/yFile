# Single Selection Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/input/singleselection/index.html).

This demo shows how to configure [GraphEditorInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode) for single selection mode. In this mode, only one graph item can be selected at a time.

## Things to Try

- Toggle single selection mode and examine the differences.
- Select a single node and toggle its selection state by pressing `Ctrl-Space`. This works in both single selection and regular mode due to a custom command binding.
- Move the node focus (indicated by a thin dashed line) by holding down `Ctrl` and pressing an arrow key. Toggle the selection state of the focused item by pressing `Ctrl-Space`.
- Take a look at the source code, especially method _enableSingleSelection_.

## Features of Single Selection Mode

- Marquee selection is disabled. Try to drag the mouse over a set of nodes to select them.
- Click-selecting multiple nodes is disabled. Try to extend the selection by holding the `Ctrl` key while clicking another node.
- _Select All_ is disabled. Try to select all nodes by pressing `Ctrl-A`.
