# SVG Export Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/view/svgexport/index.html).

This demo shows how to export the whole diagram or a part of it to an SVG file.

## Things to Try

- Resize and move the hatched rectangle to control the region which will be exported.
- _Export_ shows the exported drawing in a popup with an option to save as SVG file.
- Disable _Export Rectangle Contents_ to export the complete graph instead of the rectangle's region.
- Explore the setting for scale.

## Details

The approach used in this demo completely runs in the user's browser. It is supported by the latest versions of all major browsers. However, the save to file button won't work in IE9 but it can still be saved with right-click on the exported SVG and "Save as...".
