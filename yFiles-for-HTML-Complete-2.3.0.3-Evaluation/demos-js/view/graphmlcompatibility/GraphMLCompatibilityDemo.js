 * This demo shows how to enable backwards READ compatibility for GraphML.
 *
 * The graphml-compat.js that is bundled in this demo provides a configurator class that can be used to
 * configure a given GraphMLIOHandler instance so that it can read GraphML files written in versions prior to 2.x.
 * You can enable backwards compatibility with this single line:
 *
 * configureIOHandler(ioh);
 *
 * The compat file is human readable and can be adjusted easily.
 *
 * The resources directory contains a number of sample files from previous distributions
