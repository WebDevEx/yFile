# GraphML Compatibility Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/view/graphmlcompatibility/index.html).

The GraphML compatibility demo shows how to enable GraphML backwards compatibility for reading files written in version prior to 2.x

GraphML is the standard file format for yFiles for HTML. It is an XML format that provides great flexibility when storing custom data. The format has changed between version 2.x and earlier versions and requires conversion. The bundled `graphml-compat-js` demo file provides such a conversion layer that can be enabled just by a single line.

- Click the 'Open' button to load an older GraphML file.
- Step through the provided sample files that are created by earlier versions of yFiles for HTML.

See the sources for details.
