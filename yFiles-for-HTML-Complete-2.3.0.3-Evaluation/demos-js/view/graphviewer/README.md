# Graph Viewer Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/view/graphviewer/index.html).

The Graph Viewer demo displays several sample graphs from various domains. It allows navigating the diagram but prohibits editing.

## Things to Try

- Move the mouse over the graph and watch the hover effects. Hovering over edges will highlight the adjacent nodes, whereas hovering over nodes will highlight adjacent edges.
- Use the combo box or the navigation buttons to switch between several sample graphs.
- Write a term in the search box and see how nodes that contain the specific term are highlighted. Press Enter to focus on these specific nodes.
- Change the focused node either by clicking on it or navigating with the keyboard arrow keys.
- Various properties of the graph and the currently focused node are shown in the right pane.
- Change the zoom level by using the mouse wheel.
- Change the viewport by dragging the canvas with the mouse.
