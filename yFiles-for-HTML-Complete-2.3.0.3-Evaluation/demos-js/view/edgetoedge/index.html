    <p>
      This demo shows edge-to-edge connections. The input mode of this demo is configured to allow edges to connect
      not only to nodes but also to edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      This application also demonstrates how to provide port candidates at edges to allow interactive creation of
      edge-to-edge connections. Please take a look at the code behind to observe some of the customization possibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Things to Try</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a connection between a node and an edge by pressing the left mouse button on an unselected node and
        dragging the edge onto another edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a connection between two edges by dragging the mouse from an edge onto another edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hold down the shift modifier when moving the endpoints of an edge across another edge to create dynamic port
        candidates that best match the mouse location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start dragging the mouse from various positions on an edge to observe that the best available port location
        is chosen for the source port.
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-connect an existing edge by selecting it and dragging the source or target onto another node or edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to re-connect an edge's source or target to itself or another edge that connects to the edge that is being
        re-connected. There will be no port candidates since connecting an edge to itself or creating a mutual
        dependency is forbidden in this demo.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that the bend creation gesture has been customized in this demo. Press the Shift button and drag the
      mouse on an unselected edge to create a bend.
