            application based on the Dojo <code>cli-create-app</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is separated into different widgets utilizing both the Virtual DOM
            approach for creating the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphComponent" target="_blank">GraphComponent</a> as well as the JSX support to create

          <h2>Building the Demo</h2>
          <p>
            The demo is using <code>Dojo CLI</code>, thus the following steps are required to start
            it:
          </p>
          <code>
            {' '}
            &gt; npm install <br />
            &gt; npm run dev{' '}
          </code>
          <p>This will start the development server of the Dojo application.</p>

          <h2>Things to Try</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Toggle editing support using the &apos;Toggle Editing&apos; button.</li>
            <li>
              After the graph has been edited, click{' '}
              <img style="vertical-align: middle" src={require('../assets/reload-16.svg')} /> to
              reload the initial sample graph.
            </li>
            <li>
              The integrated development server of the Dojo CLI project will automatically update
              the application upon code changes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
