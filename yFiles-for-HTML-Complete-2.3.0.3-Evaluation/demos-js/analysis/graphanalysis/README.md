# Graph Analysis Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/analysis/graphanalysis/index.html).

## Demo Description

This demo showcases a selection of algorithms to analyse the structure of a graph.

The toolbar provides access to the most important settings of the algorithms.

Since not every algorithm presents well for every type of graph, we provide several suitable sample graphs.

The interactive editing capabilities of the graph component of this demo are explained in the [Graph Editor demo](../../view/grapheditor/).

### Things to Try

- Browse the _Sample Graphs_ and _Graph Algorithms_.
- Explore the _options_ of the algorithms.
- Modify the graph by adding or removing nodes and edges.
- Run a graph algorithm with the selected settings by pressing the _Layout_ button.
