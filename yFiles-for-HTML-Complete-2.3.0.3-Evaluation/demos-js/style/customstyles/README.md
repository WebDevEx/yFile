# Custom Styles Demo

[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/style/customstyles/index.html).

This demo shows how to create custom styles for nodes, edges, labels, ports, and edge arrows. Styles can use all the powerful visualisation features of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

## Things to Try

- Create new nodes in the canvas and inspect their styles in code.
- Create edges between nodes and inspect the custom style of the edge and the arrows in code.
- Click "Modify Colors" to change the color of the nodes and indirectly the color of the outgoing edges.
- Note that the labels look like nodes connected via an edge, however they are ordinary labels that reuse the edge style for drawing a node to label connection. Select and drag a label to move them to different locations.
- Also note that the label style depends on the current zoom. Zooming closer to the label reveals an edit label button that, when clicked, starts label text editing.
- Selecting an edge changes its color - the traditional selection indicator is not rendered.
