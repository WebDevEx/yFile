    <p>
      This demo shows how to analyze a graph by aggregating groups of nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Via the context menu, groups of nodes of the same color or shape can be aggregated giving different insights about
      the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, aggregating all nodes by <em>shape and color</em> shows  that there are no connections
      between rectangle shaped nodes of different color and no connections between octagonal green and purple nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demo makes use of the <em>AggregationGraphWrapper</em> class, that allows for aggregating graph items by hiding
      items and adding new items to a wrapped graph.
    </p>
    <h2>Things to try:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right click on a node to open a <em>context menu</em> with the different aggregation and expansion options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aggregate all nodes with the <em>same shape or color</em> by selecting "Aggregate Nodes with Same ...".
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Separate</em> an aggregation node again by selecting "Separate".
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Aggregate All Nodes by ..." to <em>group all
        nodes</em> by shape or color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Separate All" to show the whole graph again.
      </li>
    </ul>
