/**
 Populates a graph from custom data.
 This class can be used when the data specifies a collection of nodes, a collection of edges, and optionally a collection
 of groups. The properties {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#nodesSource}, {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupsSource}, and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgesSource} define the source collections from which nodes, groups, and edges will be created.
 Generally, using the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder} class consists of a few basic steps:
 <ol>
 <li>Set up the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#graph} with the proper defaults for items ({@link IGraph#nodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#groupNodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#edgeDefaults})
 <li>Create a {@link SimpleGraphBuilder}.
 <li>Set the items sources. At the very least the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#nodesSource} (unless using {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#lazyNodeDefinition}) and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgesSource} are needed. If the items in the nodes collection are
 grouped somehow, then also set the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupsSource} property.
 <li>Set up the bindings so that a graph structure can actually be created from the items sources. This involves at least
 setting up the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#sourceNodeBinding} and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#targetNodeBinding} properties so that edges can be created. If the edge objects don't actually contain the node
 objects as source and target, but instead an identifier of the node objects, then {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#sourceNodeBinding} and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#targetNodeBinding} would return those identifiers
 and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#nodeIdBinding} must be set to return that identifier when given a node object.
 <li>If {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupsSource} is set, then you also need to set the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupBinding} property to enable mapping nodes to groups. Just like with edges and their
 source and target nodes, if the node object only contains an identifier for a group node and not the actual group
 object, then return the identifier in the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupBinding} and set up the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupIdBinding} to map group node objects to their identifiers. If group
 nodes can nest, you also need the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#parentGroupBinding}.
 <li>You can also easily create labels for nodes, groups, and edges by using the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#nodeLabelBinding}, {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#groupLabelBinding}, and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} properties.
 <li>Call {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#buildGraph} to populate the graph. You can apply a layout algorithm afterward to make
 the graph look nice.
 <li>If your items or collections change later, call {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#updateGraph} to make those changes visible in
 the graph.
 </ol>
 You can further customize how nodes, groups, and edges are created by adding event handlers to the various events and
 modifying the items there. This can be used to modify items in ways that are not directly supported by the available
 bindings or defaults. This includes scenarios such as the following:
 <ul>
 <li>Setting node positions or adding bends to edges. Often a layout is applied to the graph after building it, so these
 things are only rarely needed.
 <li>Modifying individual items, such as setting a different style for every nodes, depending on the bound object.
 <li>Adding more than one label for an item, as the {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#nodeLabelBinding} and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} will only create a single label, or adding labels to group nodes.
 </ul>
 There are creation and update events for all three types of items, which allows separate customization when nodes,
 groups, and edges are created or updated. For completely static graphs where {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#updateGraph} is
 not needed, the update events can be safely ignored.
 Depending on how the source data is laid out, you may also consider using {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder},
 where node objects know their neighbors, or {@link SimpleTreeBuilder} where the graph is a tree and node objects know
 their children. Both of those other graph builders make edges implicit through the relationships between nodes and thus
 have no {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgesSource}.
 <h2>Note</h2>
 This class serves as a convenient way to create general graphs and has some limitations:
 <ul>
 <li>When populating the graph for the first time it will be cleared of all existing items.
 <li>Elements manually created on the graph in between calls to {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#updateGraph} may not be
 preserved.
 <li>Edge objects in {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#edgesSource} cannot change their source or target node. {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#sourceNodeBinding} and {@link SimpleGraphBuilder#targetNodeBinding} are only used during edge creation.
 </ul>
 If updates get too complex it's often better to write the code interfacing with the graph by hand instead of relying on
 {@link SimpleGraphBuilder}.
 The different graph builders are discussed in the section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder Creating a Graph from Business Data}. Class <code>GraphBuilder</code>, in
 particular, is topic of section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder-GraphBuilder GraphBuilder}.

/**
 Populates a graph from custom data where objects corresponding to nodes have a parent-child relationship.
 This class can be used when the data specifies a collection of nodes, each of which knows its child nodes,
 andoptionallya collection of groups. The properties {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodesSource} and {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupsSource} define the source collections from which nodes and groups
 will be created.
 Generally, using the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder} class consists of a few basic steps:
 <ol>
 <li>Set up the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#graph} with the proper defaults for items ({@link IGraph#nodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#groupNodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#edgeDefaults})
 <li>Create a {@link SimpleTreeBuilder}.
 <li>Set the items sources. At the very least the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodesSource} is needed. Note that the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodesSource} does not have to contain all nodes, as nodes
 that are implicitly specified through the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#childBinding} are automatically added to the graph as well. If the items in the nodes
 collection are grouped somehow, then also set the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupsSource} property.
 <li>Set up the bindings so that a graph structure can actually be created from the items sources. This involves setting up
 the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#childBinding} property so that edges can be created. If the node objects don't actually contain their children objects, but
 instead identifiers of other node objects, then {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#childBinding} would return those identifiers and {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#idBinding} must be set to return that
 identifier when given a node object.
 <li>If {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupsSource} is set, then you also need to set the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupBinding} property to enable mapping nodes to groups. Just like with a node's children,
 if the node object only contains an identifier for a group node and not the actual group object, then return the
 identifier in the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupBinding} and set up the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupIdBinding} to map group node objects to their identifiers. If group nodes can nest, you also
 need the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#parentGroupBinding}.
 <li>You can also easily create labels for nodes, groups, and edges by using the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodeLabelBinding}, {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#groupLabelBinding}, and {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} properties.
 <li>Call {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#buildGraph} to populate the graph. You can apply a layout algorithm afterward to make the
 graph look nice.
 <li>If your items or collections change later, call {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#updateGraph} to make those changes visible in
 the graph.
 </ol>
 You can further customize how nodes, groups, and edges are created by adding event handlers to the various events and
 modifying the items there. This can be used to modify items in ways that are not directly supported by the available
 bindings or defaults. This includes scenarios such as the following:
 <ul>
 <li>Setting node positions or adding bends to edges. Often a layout is applied to the graph after building it, so these
 things are only rarely needed.
 <li>Modifying individual items, such as setting a different style for every nodes, depending on the bound object.
 <li>Adding more than one label for an item, as the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodeLabelBinding} and {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} will only create a single label, or adding labels to group nodes.
 </ul>
 There are creation and update events for all three types of items, which allows separate customization when nodes,
 groups, and edges are created or updated. For completely static graphs where {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#updateGraph} is
 not needed, the update events can be safely ignored.
 Depending on how the source data is laid out, you may also consider using {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder},
 where node objects know their neighbors, or {@link SimpleGraphBuilder} which is a more general approach to creating
 arbitrary graphs.
 <h2>Note</h2>
 This class serves as a convenient way to create trees or forests and has some limitations:
 <ul>
 <li>When populating the graph for the first time it will be cleared of all existing items.
 <li>When using a {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#idBinding}, all nodes have to exist in the {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#nodesSource}. Nodes cannot be created on demand from IDs only.
 <li>Elements manually created on the graph in between calls to {@link SimpleTreeBuilder#updateGraph} may not be preserved.
 </ul>
 If updates get too complex it's often better to write the code interfacing with the graph by hand instead of relying on
 {@link SimpleTreeBuilder}.
 The different graph builders are discussed in the section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder Creating a Graph from Business Data}. Class <code>TreeBuilder</code>, in
 particular, is topic of section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder-TreeBuilder TreeBuilder}.

/**
 Populates a graph from custom data where objects corresponding to nodes know their neighbors.
 This class can be used when the data specifies a collection of nodes in which each node knows its direct neighbors,
 and—optionally—a collection of groups. The properties {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodesSource} and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupsSource} define the source collections from which nodes and groups
 will be created.

 Generally, using the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder} class consists of a few basic steps:

 <ol>
 <li>Set up the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#graph} with the proper defaults for items ({@link IGraph#nodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#groupNodeDefaults}, {@link IGraph#edgeDefaults})
 <li>Create an {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder}.
 <li>Set the items sources. At the very least the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodesSource} is needed. Note that the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodesSource} does not have to contain all nodes, as nodes
 that are implicitly specified through the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#predecessorsBinding} and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#successorsBinding} are automatically added to the graph as well. If the items in the nodes
 collection are grouped somehow, then also set the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupsSource} property.
 <li>Set up the bindings so that a graph structure can actually be created from the items sources. This involves at least
 setting up either the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#predecessorsBinding} or {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#successorsBinding} property so that edges can be created. If the node objects don't actually contain their
 neighboring node objects, but instead identifiers of other node objects, then {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#predecessorsBinding} and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#successorsBinding} would return those identifiers and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodeIdBinding}
 must be set to return that identifier when given a node object.
 <li>If {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupsSource} is set, then you also need to set the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupBinding} property to enable mapping nodes to groups. Just like with edges and their
 source and target nodes, if the node object only contains an identifier for a group node and not the actual group
 object, then return the identifier in the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupBinding} and set up the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupIdBinding} to map group node objects to their identifiers. If group
 nodes can nest, you also need the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#parentGroupBinding}.
 <li>You can also easily create labels for nodes, groups, and edges by using the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodeLabelBinding}, {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#groupLabelBinding}, and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} properties.
 <li>Call {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#buildGraph} to populate the graph. You can apply a layout algorithm
 afterward to make the graph look nice.
 <li>If your items or collections change later, call {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#updateGraph} to make those
 changes visible in the graph.
 </ol>
 You can further customize how nodes, groups, and edges are created by adding event handlers to the various events and
 modifying the items there. This can be used to modify items in ways that are not directly supported by the available
 bindings or defaults. This includes scenarios such as the following:

 <ul>
 <li>Setting node positions or adding bends to edges. Often a layout is applied to the graph after building it, so these
 things are only rarely needed.
 <li>Modifying individual items, such as setting a different style for every nodes, depending on the bound object.
 <li>Adding more than one label for an item, as the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodeLabelBinding} and {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#edgeLabelBinding} will only create a single label, or adding labels to group nodes.
 </ul>
 There are creation and update events for all three types of items, which allows separate customization when nodes,
 groups, and edges are created or updated. For completely static graphs where {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#updateGraph}
 is not needed, the update events can be safely ignored.

 Depending on how the source data is laid out, you may also consider using {@link SimpleTreeBuilder}, where the graph is
 a tree and node objects know their children, or {@link SimpleGraphBuilder} which is a more general approach to creating
 arbitrary graphs.

 <h2>Note</h2>

 This class serves as a convenient way to create general graphs and has some limitations:

 <ul>
 <li>When populating the graph for the first time it will be cleared of all existing items.
 <li>When using a {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodeIdBinding}, all nodes have to exist in the {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#nodesSource}. Nodes cannot be created on demand from IDs only.
 <li>Elements manually created on the graph in between calls to {@link SimpleAdjacentNodesGraphBuilder#updateGraph} may not
 be preserved.
 </ul>
 If updates get too complex it's often better to write the code interfacing with the graph by hand instead of relying on
 {@link SimpleGraphBuilder}.

 The different graph builders are discussed in the section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder Creating a Graph from Business Data}. Class
 <code>AdjacentNodesGraphBuilder</code>, in particular, is topic of section {@link https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/graph_builder-AdjacentNodesGraphBuilder AdjacentNodesGraphBuilder}.
