<h2 id="LicenseGrant">2. License Grant</h2>
<a name="RightsAndLimitations"></a>
<h3>2.1. Rights and Limitations</h3>
<p>
The following rights and restrictions apply to all Licenses for the Software
granted to you under this Agreement:
</p>
<p>

in whole or in part, to a third party, except as expressly granted below.
</p>
<p>
(b) The Software may include certain files intended for distribution by you to
the users of the software applications that you create. These files are called
Redistributable(s) and include library files. You may not distribute any files,
except those that yWorks has expressly designated as Redistributable. Developer
Guide of Software (if any) or any other documents (such as API documentation)
which are intended to teach you how to use the Software are not considered
Redistributable(s).
</p>
<p>
(c) You are entitled to deliver Redistributable(s) as part of your own
software applications.
</p>
<p>
(d) Your own software applications may not expose the functionality provided by
the Software in a way that enables a third party to use these applications as a
complete or partial replacement of the Software. This especially means that your
applications may not expose an API to a third party that will allow them to access
functionality provided by the Software. Redistributables may only be distributed
with and for the sole purpose of executing applications permitted under this Agreement
and which you have created using the Software.
</p>
<p>
(e) Software applications that include or make use of the Redistributables may
only be served from Internet/Intranet domains that have been authorized by yWorks.
</p>
<p>

(including copyright and trademark notices) of yWorks or its suppliers on, in, or
displayed by the Software.
</p>
<p>
(g) You may not reproduce or use the Software except as expressly authorized
under this Section 2.
</p>

<a name="LibraryLicense"></a>
<h3>2.2. Library License</h3>
<p>
The Library License for the Software grants you the right to use the API of the
Software Redistributables to develop software applications.
</p>
<p>
You are not allowed to reverse engineer, decompile, de-obfuscate or otherwise
attempt to derive the de-obfuscated source code of the Software, create
derivative works, modify, translate, or disassemble the Software, unless and
only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable
law or by this Agreement.
</p>

<a name="EvaluationLicense"></a>
<h3>2.2.1. Evaluation License</h3>
<p>
If you received the Software on an evaluation basis ("Evaluation License"),
then the evaluation version of the Software is licensed to you for evaluation
purposes only. The Evaluation License is a Library License. The evaluation
period is up to sixty (60) days from the date of installation or such shorter
or longer time period as set forth on the Software's packaging, license certificate,
or accompanying documentation. During the evaluation period yWorks grants you a
personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive limited license to install and execute
the Software for your personal internal use.
</p>
<p>
Upon completion of the evaluation period all copies of the Software and all
data derived from the Software have to be completely deleted unless you
acquire a regular license for the Software. If you desire to continue to
use the Software following the evaluation period, you should contact yWorks
or a yWorks' authorized reseller to order a regular license to use the Software.
</p>

<a name="SingleDeveloperLicense"></a>
<h3>2.2.2. Single Developer License</h3>
<p>
A Single Developer License is a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free Library
License for the Software. The License is valid for one (1) individual developer
who has to be specified in the License Order. The Single Developer License
grants the individual developer the right to install and use multiple copies
of the Software. Each individual developer with access to the Software needs a
Single Developer License for the Software of his own. The Single Developer License
cannot be shared or used concurrently by more than one individual developer. The
Single Developer License is NOT a 'floating' license, that is, you cannot temporarily
transfer access rights to another user. You may not transfer the Single Developer
License to another developer except for the named developer is leaving the company
or the team that is using the Software. yWorks has to be notified in writing
and provided with the name of the new-assigned individual developer.
</p>
<p>
With a Single Developer License you may serve software applications
that include or make use of the Redistributables from up to one (1)
Internet/Intranet domain that is authorized by yWorks. You may purchase
authorization for additional domains separately.
</p>

<a name="ProjectLicense"></a>
<h3>2.2.3. Project License</h3>
<p>
A Project License is a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free Library
License for the Software that is valid for one named application ("Authorized
Application" or "Authorized Project"). The Authorized Application has to be
specified in the License Order. The Project License covers new versions and
different editions of the Authorized Application as long as they are in the
evolutionary line of it.
</p>
<p>
The Project License grants you the right to use the Software concurrently
by up to three (3) individual developers participating in the Authorized
Project. For an additional License fee additional developer seats may be
added to a Project License at any time. A Project License also allows you
to use the Software as part of an automated build process for the Authorized
Project.
</p>
<p>
In case the Authorized Project changes its name, yWorks has to be notified
in writing if the Project License shall cover the new-named application. In
such cases, yWorks reserves the right to ask for a technical description
that allows yWorks to verify that the newly named Authorized Project is a
continuation of the Authorized Project.
</p>
<p>
With a Project License you may serve the software application that includes
or makes use of the Redistributables from up to two (2) different Internet/Intranet
domains that are authorized by yWorks. You may purchase authorization for
additional domains separately.
</p>

<a name="SiteLicense"></a>
<h3>2.2.4. Site License</h3>
<p>
A Site License is a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free Library License
for the Software that is valid for one authorized site. The authorized site
must be a specific place of business of Licensee that is defined by its mail
address and has to be specified in the License Order. If projects that are
hosted at different or multiple sites need to access the Software, each such
site requires a separate License for the Software. A Site License grants you
the right to share or use the Software concurrently by multiple individual
developers at the authorized site. Furthermore, it can be used with multiple
projects hosted at this site.
</p>
<p>
With a Site License you may serve software applications that include or make
use of the Redistributables from up to four (4) different Internet/Intranet
domains that are authorized by yWorks. You may purchase authorization for
additional domains separately.
</p>

<a name="AcademicLicense"></a>
<h3>2.3. Academic License</h3>
<p>
If the Software is labeled or provided to you as "Academic License", the
following restrictions to the license definitions 2.1-2.2 apply: An Academic
License restricts the use of the Software to non-commercial purposes (research,
teaching, university projects, courses and application development). Any software
application developed under an Academic License may not be licensed in whole or
in part, to a third party being a commercial institution or a party that commercially
uses the Software. Hereby, commercial institution is defined to be any company
or organization with profit interest, commercial use is defined as any use within
a commercial institution, any use with profit interest or any use within a cooperation
of two or more parties with at least one party having a profit interest.
</p>

<a name="Subscription"></a>
<h3>2.4. Subscription</h3>
<p>
Subject to the provisions contained in this Agreement, and timely payment
of the applicable fees for maintenance and support services, yWorks offers
Software maintenance and support services ("Subscription") to you. yWorks
is not obliged to provide maintenance and support services to you outside
a current Subscription.
</p>
<p>
You can enter into a Subscription along with the purchase of the Software
License ("Corresponding License"). Effective date of the Subscription is the
invoice date of the Corresponding License. Subscription is generally offered
in one-year increments. It is rendered for an initial term of twelve (12) months
from the effective date ("Initial Term").
</p>
<p>
You may purchase a renewal of your Subscription for an additional term
("Renewal Term") at the end of the Initial Term and any anniversary thereof.
If you do not purchase a renewal for your Subscription prior to the end of its
Initial or Renewal Term, your Subscription and your entitlement to receive
maintenance and support services will automatically expire.
</p>
<p>
yWorks has the right to give you notice of non-renewal at the end of a
Subscription Initial or Renewal Term for any reason, including but not
limited to circumstances where the Software has become obsolete or has been
modified. Your Subscription shall terminate immediately upon termination
of your Corresponding License.
</p>
<p>
yWorks will only support the most current maintenance release of major
versions of the Software. Six (6) months after the release of a new major
version, yWorks may stop maintaining and supporting an older major version
of the Software.
</p>
<p>
yWorks and you agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory
results during the Term of your Subscription. You understand that the level
of support that yWorks is able to provide is dependent upon your cooperation
and the quantity and quality of information that you can provide. You agree to
provide yWorks with such information as yWorks may reasonably require for
fulfilling its Subscription obligations.
</p>
<p>
Your Subscription includes (i) all versions and upgrades of the Corresponding
License released during the Term, (ii) email based technical support for the
Corresponding License and access to online support material during the Term,
and (iii) in case of a Subscription renewal for another year, the right to renew
your Subscription at expiration date for just a renewal fee.
</p>
<p>
yWorks maintains qualified personnel to provide timely and knowledgeable Subscription
services. You agree to maintain qualified personnel capable to use the Software.
</p>
<p>
When you encounter a Software problem, you need to report the problem to yWorks. In
your problem or bug report, you must include a detailed description of the problem
accompanied by a self-contained source code sample that allows yWorks to easily
reproduce the problem. yWorks will address your problem, and provide you with bug
fixes or workarounds in case of Software bugs.
</p>
<p>
yWorks does not support third party software. With respect to third party software
support, yWorks' responsibility is restricted to passing through to you any
warranties extended by the third-party.
</p>

<a name="Deliverables"></a>
<h3>2.5. Deliverables</h3>
<p>
yWorks shall provide you with the electronic documentation and with the
licensed Software (Internet delivery). The Software shall be deemed accepted
after a period of fifteen (15) days following delivery of the Software.
</p>

<a name="UpgradeEligibility"></a>
<h3>2.6. Upgrade Eligibility</h3>
<p>
As Licensee of the Software you are eligible to receive cost free upgrades
in case they belong to the generation of the Software you have licensed.
The generation of the Software is recognizable by the leading two numbers
of the Software version number string (for example Software version 5.0.1
is of generation 5.0). Free trial licenses are not eligible for free upgrading.
</p>

<a name="Backups"></a>
<h3>2.7. Backups</h3>
<p>
You may make a reasonable number of backup copies of the Software during the term
of this Agreement as long as you do not use such backup copies for any purpose other
than to replace the original copy of the Software provided to you by yWorks if such
copy is damaged or destroyed.
</p>

<h2 id="Services">3. Services</h2>
<p>
There are no services provided under this Agreement. You are responsible for
installing the Software on your computers as permitted under this Agreement.
Support, maintenance and other services must be purchased separately.
</p>

<h2 id="Disclaimer">4. Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. There is no warranty that the product
will be error-free or will function without interruption.
</p>
<p>
yWorks warrants however that the Licensed Software will be free from material
errors and will operate substantially in accordance with the related documentation
for a period of six months. Licensee's sole remedy and Licensor's sole and exclusive
liability for the breach of this warranty shall be repair or replacement of the
Licensed Software within thirty (30) days from being notified of such breach, or,
if the Licensor deems such repair or replacement impossible within the foregoing
thirty (30) days, refund fees previously paid to Licensor by Licensee for the
previous six months period.
</p>
<p>
yWorks makes no other warranties, either express or implied, regarding the
Software, including but not limited to its merchantability or its fitness
for any particular purpose. Licensee takes note of the fact that the Software
is neither developed nor intended for high risk activities such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, traffic control, direct life support
machines, or weapon systems, in which the failure of the Software could lead
directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
Any liability therefore is excluded.
</p>
<p>
yWorks provides no warranty to third parties receiving your software applications,
and you will remain solely responsible towards recipients of your software applications
for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance, and such recipients
of your software applications are not entitled to such services or assistance through yWorks.
</p>
<p>
yWorks agrees to pass through any warranties extended for third-party software,
if any, incorporated into the Software.
</p>

<h2 id="Indemnification">5. Intellectual Property Indemnification</h2>
<p>
yWorks will, at its expense, hold you harmless and defend any claim brought against you
by a third party resulting from your use of the Software, subject to the Euro amount
limitations of this Section, to the extent that such claim alleges that the Software
infringes any valid patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party protected by
the laws of the European Union, the U.S.A., Canada, Japan, Australia, Switzerland,
or Norway ("Covered Claim") and provided that such Covered Claim does not arise from
(i) your use of the Software in combination with software or other materials not
provided by yWorks; (ii) your use of the Software in a manner not in accordance with
this Agreement or for a purpose not intended by yWorks; (iii) your failure to
incorporate Software updates or upgrades provided by yWorks to you and that would
have avoided the infringement; or (iv) any modifications of the Software not made
by yWorks.
</p>
<p>
yWorks' obligations in this Section are further contingent on you notifying yWorks in
writing promptly upon obtaining notice of such impending Covered Claim. You are obliged
to give Licensor a copy of each communication relating to the Covered Claim it receives
from the claimant (except that, with respect to confidential communications, you and
yWorks will mutually agree on an appropriate non-disclosure agreement and such disclosure
is subject to the prior approval of the third party claimant ) and you will give yWorks
the authority, information and assistance necessary to defend or settle the Covered Claim
at yWorks expense, provided however, that you agree to provide complete (subject to the
limits of liability specified herein) indemnification with respect to such Covered Claim.
In no event will you have the right to enter into a settlement without yWorks' prior
written consent, and yWorks will not be liable for a settlement made without its prior
written consent. If the litigation involves other claims, then yWorks agrees to negotiate
in good faith your matters relating to the direction of the defense and sharing the cost
of defense; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall limit yWorks' ability
and authority to defend in its sole discretion any Covered Claim for which you agree to
provide complete (subject to the limits of liability specified herein) indemnification
and nothing herein shall alleviate yWorks responsibilities and liabilities hereunder.
</p>
<p>
If the Software is held to be infringed of the rights stated above in this Section and
the use of the Software is enjoined, yWorks will, or if yWorks believes the Software
might be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights yWorks may,
at its option, (i) procure for you the right to use the Software; (ii) replace or modify
the Software with other software that does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of
the infringing Software and refund to you the License fee payment made by you to yWorks
for the Software.
</p>
<p>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YWORKS' LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY
OF ITS LICENSORS OR DISTRIBUTORS, AND THE LIABILITY OF ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, UNDER THIS SECTION AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY,
WILL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE EURO 27,500. THE FOREGOING STATES YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR,
AND YWORKS' ENTIRE LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR, INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK,
COPYRIGHT, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL OR INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY RIGHT RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE.
THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST
INFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR TO ANY THIRD
PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE
TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR
INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.
</p>


<h2 id="LimitationOfLiability">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
YWORKS ACCEPTS NO FURTHER LIABILITY. In no event will yWorks or any of its licensors or
distributors or any of its and their directors, officers, employees and agents be liable
to any party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, special or punitive
damages, including any loss of profit, revenue, business opportunity or data, arising
from or relating to this Agreement or the Software, whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise, even if yWorks knew, should have known or has been advised of the possibility
of such damages. yWorks will not support or have any liability to you for use of
reformatted and recombined Redistributables. yWorks' total cumulative liability arising
from or related to this Agreement or the Software will not exceed the total amount
received by yWorks under this Agreement, and you acknowledge that the fees and prices
reflect yWorks allocation of risk.
</p>
<p>
To the extent the foregoing limitation of liability is not capable of being excluded
by applicable law, the sole liability of yWorks to you under or in connection with
this Agreement shall be limited to the greater of Euro 27500 or the License fee paid
to yWorks for the Software.
</p>

<h2 id="Thirdparty">7. Third Party Programs</h2>
<p>
To the extent the Software is bundled with third party software programs;
these third party software programs are governed by their own license terms,
which may include open source or free software licenses. Nothing in this
Agreement limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede,
the terms of any such third party software.
</p>

<h2 id="OverduePayment">8. Overdue Payment</h2>
<p>
If you are more than 30 working days in delay with a due payment yWorks shall be
entitled to require the temporary deletion of all instances of the Software until
payment has been made.
yWorks shall not be obliged to declare cancellation of the contract prior to that
demand.
</p>

<h2 id="Privacy">9. Privacy</h2>
<p>
You agree that - in conjunction with the business you have been doing with
yWorks and in accordance with the law - your company and personal data will
be saved and processed in the database of yWorks. We may use your email
address or phone number to communicate with you, for example to provide
your order status, to respond to queries, to notify you of a new release
of the Software you purchased or to remind you of the expiry of a service
agreement with us.
</p>
<p>
If not expressly disagreed by you in your License order, yWorks shall be
entitled to reference you and/or the legal entity you represent as a user
of the Software.
</p>

<h2 id="General">10. General</h2>
<h3>10.1. Applicable Law and Court of Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>

of Goods shall not apply in any way to this Agreement and the services contemplated
herein.
</p>

<h3>10.2. Waiver</h3>
<p>
Waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any Section of this Agreement shall not
be deemed a waiver of any breach or right to enforce which may thereafter occur.
</p>
<p>
Failure of either party to insist on strict compliance with any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such terms and
conditions, or of any similar right or power hereunder at any subsequent time.
</p>

<h3>10.3. Assignments</h3>
<p>
You may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of your rights
under this Agreement (including your licenses with respect to the Software) to any
third party without the prior written consent of yWorks, since the software also
contains confidential information, and any attempted assignment without such written
consent shall be null and void. yWorks' consent to an assignment shall not be
unreasonably withheld. You expressly agree that yWorks may assign its rights to any
third party any time. In case of an assignment you are entitled to terminate this
Agreement. In the event of any such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund
of the fees paid by you hereunder. Irrespective of the aforesaid, yWorks may delegate
its obligations under this Agreement without restrictions.
</p>

<h3>10.4. Term and Termination</h3>
<p>
(a) Perpetual License: If the License you have purchased is specified as "perpetual"
or no period of time is specified in the Software description or other applicable
document provided to you by yWorks, your License will be perpetual and, unless
terminated pursuant the provisions herein, you have the right to use the Software
indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
(b) Term License: If you have purchased a term License, this Agreement will
continue for the period of time specified in the Software description or other
applicable documentation provided to you by yWorks. The License will expire
automatically at the end of such term. Upon expiration of the License, the license
grants contained herein will terminate and you must cease all use of the Software.
All Sections of this Agreement which by nature should survive, will survive
expiration of the License, including, but not limited to, payment terms,
warranty disclaimers, confidentiality terms, and limitations of liability.
</p>
<p>
(c)Termination: Either party has the right to terminate this Agreement with
immediate effect, without prejudice to any available rights and remedies the
party may have, by giving written notice of termination to the other party,
if the other party breaches this Agreement and either the breach cannot be
cured or, if the breach can be cured, but it is not cured within 30 (thirty)
days after receiving written request to cure such breach.
</p>
<p>
You acknowledge that the Software contains valuable trade secrets and
proprietary information of yWorks and its suppliers, and that any actual
or threatened material breach of this Agreement by you will constitute
immediate, irreparable harm for which monetary damages might be an inadequate
remedy, and that injunctive relief is necessary for such breach. YOUR RIGHTS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TERMINATE IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT NOTICE FROM YWORKS
IF YOU MATERIALLY BREACH IT.
</p>
<p>
Should Licensee cease to conduct business in the normal course, become
insolvent or bankrupt, or if Licensee avails itself of or becomes subject
to any proceedings pertaining to insolvency or protection of creditors,
yWorks may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Licensee.
